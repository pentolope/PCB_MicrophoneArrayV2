"""Placement angles: normalisation, and the reviewed library-zero registry.

Two different things happen to a rotation on its way from a layout into a
placement file, and keeping them apart is the whole job.

*Normalisation* moves an angle into the range the assembly house reads. It is
arithmetic, it applies to everything, and it changes no part's orientation.

A *library-zero offset* does change orientation. It exists because the part's
zero orientation in the assembly house's library need not match the zero of the
footprint in the layout, and where they differ every instance of that part is
fitted turned by the difference. That is a property of the part, so it is
looked up by distributor part number and never by footprint name: two parts can
share a footprint name and differ in the house's library.

An offset must never be invented to turn a negative angle positive - that is
what normalisation is for, and an offset would turn a part that was right. And
a part with no reviewed entry is not assumed to need no offset: "we have not
looked at this one" and "we looked and it needs nothing" are different
statements, and only the second is safe to ship.
