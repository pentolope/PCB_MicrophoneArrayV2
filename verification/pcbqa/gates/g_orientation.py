"""Is every placement angle one a reviewed part number vouches for?

A placement file carries an angle per part, and two different things can be
wrong with it. The angle can be written in a range the assembly house does not
expect - the layout tool uses (-180, 180], the house reads [0, 360) - which is
the same orientation said differently and costs an engineering query. Or the
part's zero orientation in the house's library can differ from the footprint's
zero in the layout, which is not a matter of expression at all: every instance
of that part is fitted turned by the difference.

Checking the shipped file against the registry the generator used would prove
only that a program can apply its own table twice. So this gate does three
separate things instead:

  * it re-derives every offset from the frozen library evidence and requires
    the registry to agree, which is what makes the registry authoritative
    rather than self-asserted;
  * it checks coverage against the populated BOM and the board's own
    footprints, so a part that is about to be fitted cannot simply be absent
    from the registry;
  * it recomputes each shipped angle from the board and the registry.

References sharing a part number must also share a correction. That is the
failure keying by reference invites - one of a pair turned and the other not -
and it is checked from the shipped file rather than from the table.
