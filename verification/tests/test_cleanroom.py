"""Integration tests for the clean-room release.

The property under test is narrow and important: a release verdict must depend
only on artifacts the release run generated itself. Each test breaks that in one
specific way and checks the run notices - or, for the first one, checks that it
correctly does *not* care.

These are slow (each build runs ERC, DRC and four exports), so they are written
as independently addressable methods that the parallel runner can spread across
workers.
