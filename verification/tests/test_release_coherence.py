"""A release package must agree with itself, and be caught when it does not.

The defect these tests exist for is not a broken file. Every file was well
formed; they came from two different clean-room runs, and the set was a lie -
a validation report describing an archive that was not there, beside an archive
no report described, with a prose note explaining the discrepancy.

So every test here damages the package the way that actually happens: it puts
a file from another, equally valid release beside files from this one. Nothing
is corrupted, nothing is truncated, and a checker that only validates files one
at a time passes every one of them.

The second release is built rather than found. Looking for one in
`verification/out` meant these tests skipped entirely in a fresh checkout,
which is the one place they most need to run.

    Matching them with os.path.basename asks the *reading* host how paths are
    spelled, so a report written on Windows reads on Linux as one long
    filename and the archive it validated can never be found - the package
    then looks incoherent on one platform and coherent on the other, which is
    worse than either.

    These run the real lookup, on this host, over strings in all three shapes.
    Nothing is monkeypatched and no host is pretended to be another.
