"""Derive each part's library-zero offset from JLCPCB's own footprint.

A placement file says how far to turn a part from the orientation the assembly
house holds it in. That orientation is a property of *their* library, not of
ours, and where the two disagree every instance of the part is fitted turned by
the difference. Guessing it from a package name is how a regulator ends up
backwards: JLC's SOT-23-5 and SOT-23-6 libraries do not share a zero, so any
table indexed by "SOT-23" is wrong for one of them.

So nothing here is guessed. For each LCSC number this fetches the footprint
JLCPCB actually uses - EasyEDA is their EDA and serves it - normalises the pads
into a top view in millimetres, and compares them pad number by pad number
against the same part's KiCad footprint as placed on this board. Each candidate
offset is scored by the worst angular disagreement over all pads, so the answer
is decided by every pin rather than by pin 1 alone: a pin-1 match cannot tell a
rotation from a mirror.

Two files are frozen per part under fabrication/jlc_orientation/. The response
body exactly as served is kept under raw/, and beside it a normalised extract
recording the source URL, the retrieval date, the response length and its
SHA-256. The extract is not the response and is never described as one: it is
derived from it, and every offline command re-derives it rather than trusting
it, so tampering with the raw payload, with the extraction, or with the
registry's offset all fail rather than pass.

    tools/jlc_orientation.py freeze [LCSC ...]   fetch and record the evidence
    tools/jlc_orientation.py report              score every frozen part
    tools/jlc_orientation.py check               non-zero if any offset moved
    tools/jlc_orientation.py check-live          frozen evidence vs JLC today

Only freeze and check-live use the network. report and check read the frozen
files alone, so the test suite and the clean release never reach upstream, and
JLC changing their library is reported as upstream drift rather than as
corruption of what is committed here.
