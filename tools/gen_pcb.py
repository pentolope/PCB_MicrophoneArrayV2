"""Build microphone_array_v2.kicad_pcb from the shared netlist and placement.

Stackup rationale: both inner layers are solid ground rather than the more
usual signal/GND/power/signal. The whole board draws about 200 mA, so the
supplies are comfortable on 0.6 mm tracks, and giving every F.Cu and B.Cu trace
an unbroken adjacent reference plane matters far more here than power-plane
impedance would. It also removes any chance of a PDM clock or data line
crossing a plane split.

Ground is a plane net that the autorouter never sees, so this script places an
explicit stitching via plus a short connecting track at every ground pad.
