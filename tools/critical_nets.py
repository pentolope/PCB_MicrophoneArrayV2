"""Check the declared critical nets, using the validator's own topology rule.

The generator lays these nets down deliberately - clock spine on F.Cu with no
vias, branch trees matched end to end - and a requirement that is only enforced
by the comment above the code that writes it is not enforced at all.

Nothing is measured here. The measurement is pcbqa.rules.NetTopologyRule, the
same driver-to-load path walk the validator's NET.TOPOLOGY gate runs, driven by
the same rules in verification/boards/live.json. This module adds two things
that gate cannot: it runs during the build, on the pre-route board and again on
the routed candidate, and it checks that the manifest's limits still agree with
constraints.json, so the design's statement of the requirement and the number
being enforced cannot drift apart.
