"""Prove the host socket mates with a Raspberry Pi P1 header, pin for pin.

The array plugs straight down onto the Pi: no cable, so nothing can re-map a
pin on the way. Two things have to be true, and arguing them from footprint
library conventions is how boards get built inside out. This measures them.

**Handedness.** Lower the array onto the Pi and look down at both. Array pad n
has to land on Pi pin n, so in that one view the two pin fields must differ by
a rigid motion - a translation and a rotation - and by nothing else. If they
differ by a reflection the connector is the wrong half: pin 1 still meets pin
1, and every other pin meets its mirror image. The test fits the best rigid
transform between the two labelled point sets and refuses a determinant of -1.

**Pinout.** Every pad still carries the net the Pi's own pinout gives that pin.
A mirrored connector can be made to "work" by moving nets to different pins,
which produces a board that mates mechanically and is wired to the wrong GPIOs;
this compares the board's nets against design.PI_HEADER pin by pin.
