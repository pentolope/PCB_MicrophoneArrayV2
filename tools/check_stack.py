"""Check the array can sit on the Raspberry Pi without anything touching.

The array carries parts on its underside and the Pi carries tall connectors on
its top, and the two face each other. So the question is a height budget, not a
footprint one: for every part hanging below the array, is there room for it
above whatever the Pi has in the same place?

Because the array's 120 mm disc covers the whole of an 85.6 x 56 mm Pi, the
honest answer is to assume every underside part sits over the Pi's tallest
feature. That is conservative and it is also nearly true - the USB stack is at
one end, the array is round, and the disc reaches past both ends.

The Pi's dimensions come from constraints.json's `mechanical_stack` block,
which is published data, not a drawing held in this project. It says so, and so
does this check.
